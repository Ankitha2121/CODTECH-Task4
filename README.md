PROJECT OVERVIEW:
COMPUTER VISION

Objective:
      The objective of this project is to work on a computer vision problem involving image classification. Image classification is the process of assigning a label to an image from a predefined set of categories. We'll use a neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular dataset used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms.

      
Install the necessary libraries by running the appropriate commands in a code cell.

Import the required libraries to build and train the model.

Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Normalize the pixel values of the images to be between 0 and 1. Define class names for the dataset and display the first 25 images from the training set to get an overview of the data.

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model will consist of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and finally, dense layers to classify the images into one of the 10 classes.

Compile and train the model using the training data. Monitor the training process by evaluating the model's performance on the validation data.

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset. Plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs to visualize the model's learning progress.

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images. Display the first few test images along with their predicted labels and the true labels to see how well the model performs.

This project provides a foundation for understanding and implementing image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Google Colab.
